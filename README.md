# Electricity Demand Estimation For Leading Electricity Distributor


Developed a comprehensive forecasting model to estimate electricity demand for the next 1-2 years based on historical data
ranging from January 1973 to December 2019. Utilized various time series forecasting techniques including Decomposition, ETS models,
and ARIMA/SARIMA models with different parameters to compare and select the most suitable model.

Selected the SARIMA model as the final forecasting model due to its superior performance in terms of accuracy metrics such as RMSE, RMSPE,
and MAPE. The SARIMA model demonstrated robustness in capturing the underlying patterns and trends in the historical data, providing reliable
estimations for future electricity demand on a monthly basis.
