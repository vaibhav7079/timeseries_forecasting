# Electricity Demand Estimation For Leading Electricity Distributor


Business Context: One of leading electricity Distribution Company would like to understand demand for electricity for the next 1-2 years to manage the production of electricity and managing the vendors for the same. It is one of the important exercises to getting accurate estimation of demand so that they can procure or produce the electricity as per the demand.

Available Data: The data of monthly electricity consumption available starting from January 1973 to December 2019. We need to forecast the demand for next two years.

Date – Month & Year
Electricity Consumption – Electricity consumption in Trillion Watts
Business Objective: a. Need to forecast the demand of electricity for next 1-2 years. b. Calculate error metrics (RMSE, RMSPE, MAPE) c. Compare various models including Decomposition, ETS models, ARIMA/SARIMA Models with various parameters etc…


Developed a comprehensive forecasting model to estimate electricity demand for the next 1-2 years based on historical data
ranging from January 1973 to December 2019. Utilized various time series forecasting techniques including Decomposition, ETS models,
and ARIMA/SARIMA models with different parameters to compare and select the most suitable model.

Selected the SARIMA model as the final forecasting model due to its superior performance in terms of accuracy metrics such as RMSE, RMSPE,
and MAPE. The SARIMA model demonstrated robustness in capturing the underlying patterns and trends in the historical data, providing reliable
estimations for future electricity demand on a monthly basis.
